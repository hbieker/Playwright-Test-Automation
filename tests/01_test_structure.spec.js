//Import Playwright Module
//const {test} = require('@playwright/test');

//Test Annotation takes 2 arguments - test case name & test function
//Marking function with async to allow for awaits
//function() converted to ()=> for lighter code
//Basic syntax for each test is as follows

//test('test_case_name', async ()=>
//{
    //Playwright Code
    //javascript is asynchronous
    //must explicitly tell it to wait
//    await
    //step 1
 //   await
    //step 2
 //   await
    //step 3
//});
